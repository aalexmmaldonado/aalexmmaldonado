## Ollo!

- :microscope: Postdoctoral Associate in the [Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/) working with [Dr. Jacob Durrant](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/). My work involves molecular simulations, machine learning, and quantum chemistry to investigate protein-ligand interactions and structure-based drug design.
- :man_teacher: Teaches undergraduate courses in computational biology.
- :books: [Chemical Engineering Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/chemicalpetroleum) under [Dr. John Keith](http://www.klic.pitt.edu/).
My research was focused on the computational modeling of solvated chemical reactions using quantum chemistry, molecular simulations, and machine learning.
- :paintbrush: Finding ways to elegantly visualize and present scientific concepts and data.
