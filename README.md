### Ollo!

My name is Alex M. Maldonado (he/him).
In short, I am a chemical engineering Ph.D. student at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/).
I explore how to predict chemical reactions in solvents using state-of-the-art quantum chemistry and machine learning with [Dr. John Keith](http://www.klic.pitt.edu/).

### Interests

Like many, my interests have grown with time.
What has stayed constant, though, is my fascination with molecular biology.
How the multitudes of molecular machines work together to be life is, amazing.
While each individual component has its crucial role, proteins are the ultimate stop.
Understanding the tertiary structure of proteins from its amino acid sequence is one of the monumental challenges ahead of us; one that I wish to contribute to.

### Projects

I am taking a convoluted way of getting to my desired field.
My endeavors in quantum and statistical mechanics will provide a ground-up understanding for macromolecules.
Quantum-level detail in larger systems and time scales, however, requires course graining and/or machine learning.
Furthermore, the protein structure itself is influenced by the local environment.
Thus, I am learning how to model such solvent interactions with quantum-chemical accuracy and machine learning.
