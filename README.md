### Ollo!

My name is Alex M. Maldonado (he/him).
In short, I am a chemical engineering Ph.D. student at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/).
I explore how to predict chemical reactions in solvents using state-of-the-art quantum chemistry and machine learning with [Dr. John Keith](http://www.klic.pitt.edu/).

### Values

**Open Knowledge**\
Social mobility in today's modern world is [tied to educational opportunities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#Influence_of_intelligence_and_education).
High-quality educators, or even resources, are not always available through traditional routes.
The [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) has revolutionized our consumption and retention of knowledge.
Now, we all can [stand on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants).

**Skepticism**\
Challenging assumptions and preconceived notions are essential for efficient progression of science.
This requires personal diligence in being aware of one's use of [logical fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies) and [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).
Shout out to [Chasz Griego](https://twitter.com/ChaszGriego) for introducing me to the [skeptics guide to the universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/)!

**Reproducibility**\
Computational sciences are in the midsts of a [reproducibility crisis](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/chemistrys-reproducibility-crisis-that-youve-probably-never-heard-of/4011693.article).
Codes should be well documented and publicly available; shifting the burden of reproducibility away from trust.
All input and output files [should be provided](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b00799) to describe exact computational conditions.
Whenever possible, all files pertaining to a study should be available under an open-source license (like [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)).

### Interests

Like many, my interests have grown with time.
What has stayed constant, though, is my fascination with molecular biology.
How the multitudes of molecular machines work together to be life is, amazing.
While each individual component has its crucial role, proteins are the ultimate stop.
Understanding the tertiary structure of proteins from its amino acid sequence is one of the monumental challenges ahead of us; one that I wish to contribute to.

I am taking a convoluted way of getting there.
My endeavors in quantum and statistical mechanics will provide a ground-up understanding for macromolecules.
Quantum-level detail in larger systems and time scales, however, requires course graining and/or machine learning.
Furthermore, the protein structure itself is influenced by the local environment.
Thus, I am learning how to model such solvent interactions with quantum-chemical accuracy and machine learning.

### Projects

**Reactions in Solvents**\

**Knowledge Documentation**\
During my time at Pitt I started documenting my information and experience in a [TiddlyWiki](https://aalexmmaldonado.com/html/projects/compcrumbs.html).
It is filled with literature I find, techniques I use, and explanations of concepts.
This is not meant to be an authoritative reference on anything; more similar to a trail of breadcrumbs towards expertise.
