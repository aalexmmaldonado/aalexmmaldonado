### Ollo!

My name is Alex M. Maldonado (he/him) and more information about me can be found on [my website](https://aalexmmaldonado.com/).
In short, I am a chemical engineering Ph.D. student at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/).
I explore how to predict chemical reactions in solvents using state-of-the-art quantum chemistry and machine learning with [Dr. John Keith](http://www.klic.pitt.edu/).

### Interests

A longterm research goal of mine is to get involved in computational biology.
Understanding the tertiary structure of proteins from its amino acid sequence is, to me, one of the monumental challenges ahead of us; one that I wish to contribute to.
Scientific visual communication has also been a longtime passion.
I do what I can with my scientific presentations and publications; however, interactive infographics have been catching my attention for a while now!
Getting more experience with these types of works is on my long to-do list.

### Projects

#### Modeling Solvated Reaction Mechanisms

I have a few projects concerning modeling solvent effects in computational chemistry.
For example, my [many-body gradient domain machine learning (mbGDML)](https://github.com/keithgroup/mbGDML) project is an effort to using kernel-based machine learning force fields for explicit solvent simulations.
You can see a "short" (~12 minutes) virtual presentation about this [here](https://vimeo.com/474697327).

#### Computational Reproducibility

Many publications within my field seem to be lacking greatly in reproducibility; output files or sufficient detail to reproduce calculations are rarely given.
These publications are just [advertisements of what those researchers can do](https://doi.org/10.4155/fmc.12.160).
In an effort for more reproducibility in my own work, I have been writing a Python package that uses modified [QCSchemas](https://github.com/MolSSI/QCSchema) to convert quantum chemistry output files into [QCJSONs](https://github.com/keithgroup/qcjson).
Also, data sets containing all calculations, analysis scripts, and figures are published alongside my works.
For example:

- [Solvation Procedures Assessment of Borohydride Reduction of Carbon Dioxide](https://zenodo.org/record/4336730),
- [A collection of local minima for solvent and solute-solvent clusters](https://github.com/keithgroup/solute-solvent-clusters).
