### Ollo!

My name is Alex M. Maldonado (he/him).
In short, I am a chemical engineering Ph.D. student at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/).
I explore how to predict chemical reactions that occur in solvents using state-of-the-art quantum chemistry and machine learning with [Dr. John Keith](http://www.klic.pitt.edu/).

### Values

**Open Knowledge**\
Social mobility in today's modern world is intimately [tied to educational opportunities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#Influence_of_intelligence_and_education).
High-quality educators, or even resources, are not widely available through traditional routes.
Thus, educational materials must be accessible to all.

The [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) has revolutionized our consumption and retention of knowledge.
Now, we all can [stand on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants).
However, gaps between novice and expert are often too vast without immense time and dedicated mentorship.
I am privileged to have received both and am working to reduce the barrier for others.

**Skepticism**\
Certainty and steadfastness are dangerous characteristics that often limit ones potential.
Challenging assumptions and preconceived notions are essential for efficient progression of science.
This requires personal diligence in being aware of ones use of [logical fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies) and [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).

Shout out to [Chasz Griego](https://twitter.com/ChaszGriego) for introducing me to the [skeptics guide to the universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/)!

**Reproducibility**\
Computational sciences are in the midsts of a [reproducibility crisis](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/chemistrys-reproducibility-crisis-that-youve-probably-never-heard-of/4011693.article).
In the center: software.
Codes ideally should be well documented and publicly available.
This is often an issue with commercial software; shifting the burden of reproducibility to trust---something not commonly associated with science.
Even so, software is not isolated; it has its own dependencies that change over time and should be held to the same standards.
Computational researchers should strive more towards using and developing software with these values.

Without vast open-source software, input and output files [can provide specific details of computations](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b00799) such as software specifications and inputs.
Results presented in manuscripts and reports can be scrutinized, and even support others research endeavors.
Whenever possible, all files pertaining to a study should be available under an open-source license (like [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)).

### Interests

Like many, my interests have grown with time.
What has stayed constant is my fascination with molecular biology.
Being exposed to how the many multitudes of molecular machines work together to be life.
While each individual component has its crucial role, proteins are the ultimate stop.
Understanding the tertiary structure of proteins from its amino acid sequence is one of the monumental challenges ahead of us.
One that I wish to contribute to.

I am taking a convoluted way of getting there.
During my Bachelors I was involved in developing point-of-care immunodiagnostics; where I appreciated the applications and importance of antibodies.
Now, in my Ph.D., I focus on a much smaller scale.
My endeavors in quantum and statistical mechanics provide a ground-up understanding for macromolecules.
Machine learning is one promising way to bring the quantum real to the larger scale.
The local environment also plays just as an import role in protein structures.

### Projects

**Reactions in Solvents**\
TODO

**Knowledge Documentation**\
During my time at Pitt I started documenting my information and experience in a [TiddlyWiki](https://aalexmmaldonado.com/html/projects/compcrumbs.html).
It is filled with literature I find, techniques I use, and explanations of concepts.
This is not meant to be an authoritative reference on anything; more similar to a trail of breadcrumbs towards expertise.
